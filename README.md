# spotify_data_analyzer
A project which takes Spotify listening data and creates visualizations of the data. 

I made this project to get some practice using the tools I learned in my Data Science Cetification.

This project contains a script which will run the artist per month analysis and generate the month by month visualizations. 

The libraries I used are listed in the __requirements.txt__ file.

Running the script is as simple as running this command 
``` 
python3 PATH_TO_SCRIPT PATH_TO_SPOTIFY_DATA
``` 

The notebooks contained within this directory contain more information on my thought and development process as well as some insights I generated into my personal data.
